# Radar-Spoofing-Simulation-Code
Running the code is simple, you just need to press the run button and that is it. 

Code at the bottom of the file is used to toggle spoofing, change range, change velocity, and which plots you want to see. Currently all but the freq-domain chirp
and range-Doppler map are commented out, but they can easily be shown by uncommenting the code.

The required libraries are numpy and matplotlib.pyplot

The runtime is negligible and near zero
